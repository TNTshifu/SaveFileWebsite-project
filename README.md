# Website redesign 

This is my project for the final task of the course Web & App Development and Business. 

## Project Goals

- Redesign and improve an existing website
- Rebuild at least 3 main pages
- Make the design responsive for desktop and mobile
- Integrate it into Wordpress as a theme
- Make as many elements ditable in Wordpress dashboard as possible


## Tech Stack

- **HTML 5**
- **CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid)**
- **JavaScript**
- **Wordpress (Local)**
- **Git & GitHub**


## Project Structure
/SaveFileWebsite-project
│
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── /images

Later, this design will be turned into a WordPress theme inside:
/wp-content/themes/SaveFileWebsite-project/


## Wireframes

Before coding, I created wireframes for both **desktop** and **mobile** layouts.  
They guided my layout choices and responsive design.

*(Optional: screenshots of thewireframes)*

## How to View the Project

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. (Later) You can install the WordPress theme version using **Local** and activate it under *Appearance → Themes*
